# Sephia Mail

A blistering fast, secure, virus free, and PGP encrypted/signed alternative to GMail.

Put the main _"/sephia-mail/"_ folder inside of your _"/phosphorusfive/core/p5.webapp/system42/apps/"_
folder to _"install"_ Sephia Mail. This can be done by either downloading the latest release, or by
cloning the main Sephia Repository directly inside of this folder.
